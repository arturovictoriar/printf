\fBFormat of the format string\fP
.RE
The  format  string  is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The
format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied
unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero
or more subsequent arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character \fI%\fP, and ends with a \fIconversion specifier\fP.

NOTE:  your  shell  may have its own version of printf, which usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for
details about the options it supports.
